Inspired by https://github.com/Altpapier/GlintCreator.

I got the enchantment glint frames in `+frames/+` via https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/User:MrJam003/Animated_Sprites_Render,
specifically downloaded from https://mega.nz/folder/GZ1jhK6L#amWjVrNWt0dTiF2dhsYhXw which are originally from
https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft[Minecraft] Java Edition.
